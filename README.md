# 🩺 Healthcare Appointment & Triage Assistant

> *"Because nobody should have to guess how urgent their symptoms are."*

An **NHS-inspired**, AI-powered healthcare platform that helps patients describe symptoms, receive an intelligent triage suggestion, and book the right appointment — all while giving admins a real-time pulse on clinic operations.

Built end-to-end as a portfolio project spanning **Data Analytics, Data Science, Machine Learning, Generative AI, and Full-Stack Engineering.**

## ✨ Why this project exists

Healthcare shouldn't feel like a maze. Patients often don't know whether their symptoms need a routine check-up or urgent care — and clinics lose time and money to no-shows they can't predict.

This project simulates a smarter, calmer version of that experience: describe how you feel, get a sensible triage suggestion, book a slot, and chat with an AI assistant grounded in trusted public guidance — no guesswork, no dead ends.

> ⚠️ **Educational project only.** Built with public and synthetic data. Not affiliated with the NHS. Not a substitute for real medical advice. **In an emergency, always call 999 (UK) or your local emergency number.**

## 🚀 The build journey — 3 months, 3 chapters

### 📦 Month 1 — Foundations
Setting the stage: repo, datasets, database schema, and a working backend skeleton.

### 🤖 Month 2 — Intelligence
Teaching the system to think: feature engineering, model training, and a frontend that brings it to life.

### 💡 Month 3 — Conversation
Giving it a voice: a Generative AI chatbot with retrieval-augmented answers, full integration, testing, and deployment.

## 📊 The datasets behind it

No real patient data — ever. Just public and synthetic sources:

- **Medical Appointment No-Shows** (Kaggle) — ~110k real-world booking records
- **Synthea** (MITRE) — fully synthetic patient generator
- **NHS England Open Data** — GP appointment statistics
- **NICE Clinical Knowledge Summaries** — grounding text for the AI chatbot

---

## 🔒 Built responsibly

- ✅ Only public/synthetic data, always
- ✅ No secrets or credentials ever committed
- ✅ Prompt-injection safeguards on the chatbot
- ✅ Visible medical disclaimer in every screen
- ✅ UK GDPR-style data handling, even for demo data
